# SecurityLaserTrap
This work is aimed to improve what has been done in this youtube link 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmZJkF9jBwo&amp;t=90s which is created by Blue Matter. The difference that was made in this project is that
we do not have to use buzzer. Instead, we will combine Processing and Arduino to generate alarm sound from the pc speaker when there is an object blocking the laser light.
